				Viewed from thirty-thousand feet, the typical experience with the American education system is well-characterized as one of gradual convergence. Primary school is a guided introduction to a moderately diverse cookie-cutter set of topics: science, math, and history are dished out with a side of the arts. In some ways, this early educational structure makes sense. As Ian Leslie argues in his book, Curious, educational guidance is required to kickstart a student’s curiosity. Leslie states “The more knowledge children acquire early on, the better they are at learning, and the more they will enjoy learning. Just as start-ups need to borrow large amounts of capital to kick-start their growth, so children depend on knowledge transmitted by teachers to fuel their nascent intellectual curiosity” [1].
			</p>
			<p>
				After thirteen years of accumulating knowledge in primary and secondary school, it is assumed that students are well-primed to plan their future. Not yet legal to drink a beer, every eighteen-year-old American is all-of-a-sudden free to smoke cigarettes, purchase scratch-off lottery tickets, and select the specialty on which their future careers will be based. Exercising any one of these freedoms is a poor decision.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is not that I disagree with the decision to pursue one’s passion, but rather that I believe that so few of us know what it is that we’re passionate about at the age of eighteen. Primary school does well to spark students’ desire to learn, but that desire does not immediately unlock some greater understanding of ourselves. It’s the same argument for why so few of us marry our high school sweethearts. Puberty kicks in and we develop some desire to date, but only a small minority find their passion early on. The rest of us go through years of dating to learn about ourselves and what we care about.
			</p>
			<p>
				Students are pressured into making an uninformed decision about their careers. In one survey, more than 800 students were asked to elaborate on their career decision-making process. The study found that “students are choosing a major based on influence and assumption rather than through an understanding of their own personal goals and values” [2].
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe that the American education system is encouraging — really, strong-arming — students into skipping a critical step in their own personal development: self-guided exploration. The continuous funnel from primary education into higher education does not provide students the full opportunity to explore, make mistakes, learn about themselves, and adjust.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, some of you reading this may push back here and argue that college does just this. Sure, there are clubs, electives, and study abroad programs that offer some flexibility to explore one’s interests. Some schools, such as Brown University and Olin College, offer greater breadth in learning than others, but even those programs only do so much for students.
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe that the underlying structure of the four-year undergraduate education is broken.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my parents’ day, a college degree guaranteed you employment. In describing university degrees as a currency, Ken Robinson argues that “university degrees used to have high market value in part because relatively few people had them. [3]” In the 1970’s, about 1 in 20 people went on to earn an undergraduate degree [3]. It was a wise choice then, if you knew your passion, to pursue a college degree because students were confident that they would be working in a relevant field upon graduation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, one in three high school students go on to earn a college degree [3], and that college degree no longer guarantees relevant employment. Students today are pursuing a college degree not to pursue their passion, but because it is what everyone else is doing. They are pressured by their peers and their parents to pursue an opportunity that can no longer keep the promise it kept for the past generation.
			</p>
			<p>
				With a higher percentage of the population pursuing a degree, greater competition between graduates causes students to take a hard look at their professional direction, often forcing them to choose between what they enjoy doing and what may gain them employment. Every class that a student takes must contribute towards their employability; it must set them apart in some way.
			</p>
			<p>
				The struggle between passion and pay, or just complete uncertainty, has led 80% of students to go on to change their major at least once in their college careers [4]. This indecisiveness, which I am arguing is entirely justifiable given the fact that nearly every eighteen-year-old has little to no clue what they want in life, directly conflicts with the very notion of declaring a major. College has become a stressful experience, not due to the rigor of the curriculum, but instead because students are forced to make a decision that they are not qualified to make.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a general principle, we should discount the value of an outcome by its probability of occurring. If the desired outcome of a college degree is to gain relevant and enjoyable employment, then that would suggest that the cost of tuition should be decreasing. Of course, the complete opposite is true: tuition is rising at alarming rates.
			</p>
			<p>
				What if, instead, we shifted the lens through which we viewed undergraduate education? What if the goal were not to gain employment? What if the purpose of undergraduate education were to help students explore and find their passion; their niche? What would this look like?
			</p>
			<p>
				In my opinion, things wouldn’t have to change very much. Higher education would just have to shed itself of some of its structure.
			</p>
			<p>
				To start, I would make the idea of a ‘major’ completely optional. Students should have total freedom to choose to pursue depth or breadth in their studies. If universities placed a greater emphasis on the individual courses that a student took, rather than the bundle of courses within a specific major, it would do wonderful things for a student’s freedom.
			</p>
			<p>
				No longer would students who switched majors feel as if they had wasted time and money pursuing some other direction. No longer would college dropouts be viewed in a negative lens — they just simply didn’t do four years of college. No longer would students be driven to finish their degrees as soon as possible so that they could enter the workforce. Students might instead inject periods of travel and work into their college experience in ways that might enrich their experience while in the classroom.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is so much evidence that suggests that such a concept could fit in our society. Many employers care less about your degree than your general ability to learn and apply yourself. Projects and experience demonstrate one’s ability more accurately than one’s college diploma and GPA.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a student did decide they wanted to further specialize their studies, graduate school is the perfect opportunity to do so. Again — many graduate programs don’t require an undergraduate degree that directly pertains to one’s intended course of graduate studies. If a undergraduate business degree isn’t required to pursue an MBA, then why wouldn’t undergraduate business students instead study whatever happened to inspire them? They would still be developing their ability to learn, it would just be a more personalized experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				This concept of placing greater emphasis on experiences and personalized education over specialized majors also empowers other forms of education. Consider how MOOCs, extended periods of global travel, and non-university student-mentor relationships may fit in and provide value.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ultimately, what it boils down to is that our education system is well-entwined with our culture and our economy. As our culture grows and adapts, so must our approach to education. It’s no secret that our education system has recently become strained; the system is ripping open in many places, suggesting reform is necessary. I believe that how students are recognized for their effort and their learning in higher education is one such hole.
			</p>
			<p>
				I wrote this essay over my Sunday morning coffee (I may have had a few cups), and so I don’t believe that I have the solution. Any idea that I think up in such a short period of time is bound to be half-baked, and so I encourage you — if you feel so inspired — to contribute to this conversation and add your own ideas.
