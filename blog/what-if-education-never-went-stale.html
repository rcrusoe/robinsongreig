				The original American higher education institutions agreed on an approach that aimed to develop nothing more than mental grit in students through tedious tasks of translating ancient languages and completing sets of mathematical problems.  As times changed and more universities were created, American education has gone through periods of reform and decentralization that have reshaped curriculum in many different ways.
			</p>
			<p>
				The curriculum of the original approach was heavily scripted, and the curriculum of the liberal approach that followed was an overcompensation that allowed students total freedom to define their own path.
			</p>
			<p>
				The current state of education has landed somewhere in the middle.  Students choose a topic to study in depth and they gain a breadth of education by completing some small required number of courses in disparate topics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Declaring a major in college is one of the most pivotal decisions that we face in our lives.  It is a commitment to study a discipline for four years in order to set one’s professional trajectory. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe that much of what makes this decision so difficult is that what students choose to major in is an extrapolation from what they are passionate about.
			</p>
			<p>
				We never say “I am passionate about the human anatomy,” or “I want to spend my life designing mechanisms.”  We don’t define their passion by the daily tasks that might make up their profession; they define passion through a macro perspective of the impact they want to have in the world.  We want to help relieve poverty overseas or redefine the future of transportation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Students are forced to boil their vision down to a developing a skill set that may later be applied to their passion.  Unfortunately, it’s difficult to seek out employment that directly matches a student’s passion with the skill set they have developed.  Graduates often find themselves in a position that is a heavily-diluted version of their original passion, which has contributed to a generation that is changing careers more frequently than any generation in the past.
			</p>
			<p>
				Learning in the workplace is different.  Employees seek out knowledge that is directly relevant to the challenge they are tackling.  Workplace learning has purpose, rather than an abstract extrapolation of purpose.
			</p>
			<p>
				What if this purpose-driven learning were applied to education?
			</p>
			<p>
				Students could express the purpose of their education in terms of their passion and explore solutions to water pollution, the future of virtual reality, or how we may use energy more intelligently.  Instead of defining a major, students would investigate the current state of the world, driven by their own curiosity.  Students would be connected to professors and other students at the university that would direct them to relevant resources and mentor them when they had questions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In this model, students would have the freedom to dive deep or go broad in the skills they develop, based on the needs of the area they are exploring.  Students would still develop skills that are relevant to their future employment, but they would be able to discuss their skills not in terms of accreditation, but instead in terms of the work they’ve done, what they have created, and the impact they have had on the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Purpose-driven education would be flexible, but focused.  Students would only stay at university for as long as they found it valuable.  Some may leave after a year to go explore a new opportunity elsewhere, while others may to stick around for years to pursue a research opportunity with a mentor on campus.  Education duration that is defined by value would frame universities as a resource rather than a gateway, and students would have the flexibility to decide how and when they use that resource.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the problems that I have with the concept of declaring a major is that it can go stale.  The world is a rapidly changing place, especially given the speed at which we are currently advancing technology.  The demand for various occupations is constantly rising and falling so focusing one’s education based on developing a skill set that in the future may no longer be needed is an inherently risky decision.  Selecting a major is very much like investing in the stock market: the decision is obvious if you can predict the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				The beauty of what I’m calling purpose-driven learning is that it will always be relevant.  If universities were structured as a flexible bank of resources that included workshops, online classes, mentors, and more, they would always be setup to provide value to students who were exploring current issues.
