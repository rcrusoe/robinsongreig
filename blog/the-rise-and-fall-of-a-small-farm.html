				I was wading through the tall meadow grass like I was in the thick of the Amazon. The beast I was pursuing was just a few yards away and she towered over me in an intimidating fashion. She must have been ten or twelve times my size, but there was something so gentle about her.
			</p>
			<p>
				My heart was pounding at the inside of my chest.
			</p>
			<p>
				I took a deep breath and trekked forward at the slow and steady pace that Paul, our herdsman, had trained me to follow. I was just two feet away now and standing off to the side, being careful to stay out of striking range of the animal’s heavy hoof. She was just standing there, made dormant by the warm June sun.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>SSMMAAAAAACCCKKKK</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				The black plastic tube rang in my hands as I brought it down on the animal’s hind quarters. She let out a low grunt as she lurched forward through the gate.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was four years old then. I didn’t get to do it often, but herding our Holstein cows back down to the homestead was one of my favorite things to do on the farm.
			</p>

			<p>
				That was when the farm was full of life. Our little farm, nestled in the Catskill Mountains, was home to not just seventy cows, but four pigs, a dozen or so goats, and a small flock of chickens. The most incredible animals on the farm though — without a doubt, were the people.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our farm was, and still is, a pick-your-own operation open to the public. The pastures that supported our small herd of cows were surrounded by a cornucopia of berries, apples, and pumpkins. Throughout the harvest season, our little patch attracted thousands — some of whom had been visiting every year since the 1940’s, when my grandparents purchased the first parcel of land.
			</p>
			<img src="blog-images/berries.jpg">
			<p>
				To my dad, farming was about more than just agriculture. It was about <i>community</i> — everyone who visited the farm was family and we genuinely wanted them to enjoy their visit. If you stopped by <a href="http://www.greigfarm.com">Greig Farm</a> in the early ‘90s, you almost certainly would have been offered a tour of the farm in a hay wagon pulled behind our old W6. After touring the farm, you would take to the fields to pick blueberries that were the size of quarters — general practice was two in the bucket, one in your mouth (the regular joke was that we weighed visitors on the way in and the way out in order to charge the for what they ate while picking). Before you left, you had to go to our market, where I kid you not — we made the best cider donuts in New York State.
			</p>

			<p>
				The farm really showed it’s character as late Autumn approached and the seasonal harvest was coming to a close. By day, we celebrated the season with harvest festivals that included local live music, straw and corn mazes, and face painting.
			</p>
			<p>
				By night, however, the farm went through a radical transformation. The hay wagons were wrapped in cobweb and the hydraulic apple pruning tractors were outfitted with homemade dragon heads and fabricated flamethrowers. My cousin, who spent his high school summers working on the farm, would grab a chain-less chainsaw and tear off into the orchards on his dirt bike. The farm staff, fueled by warm apple cider on those cold October nights, got into character to guide hundreds through the haunted house that lay hidden in the back of one of the barns. For those up to it, there was the option to board a wagon for a haunted hayride across the farm. It was the strangest thing — those old tractors that pulled the wagons, though extremely reliable during the day, often seemed to break down in the middle of our orchard at night.
			</p>

				The farm was an incredible place. The problem (and I say this as if there were only one problem) with running a small farm is that traditional economics don’t apply very well. Regardless of how well one farms the land, there is always the chance of an environmental event that wipes a crop out. <i>Poof</i>. It’s gone — better luck next year. If you have poor luck and your production is low, you can’t jack up your prices because the guy in the other micro climate down the street may have had better luck so he’s driving the market price. On the other hand, if you have a phenomenal season, you’re going to have a tough time moving all of that produce. Small farmers, for the most part, sell locally — and there’s only so much local demand for produce. The dream of a small farmer is, simply, consistency.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every small farming family lives season to season and even the most productive seasons leave little financial surplus. Despite how wonderful it is to have, small farms have no money for community.
			</p>

				The 1990s brought Greig Farm a decade of agricultural disasters — everything from a late spring frost that pinched off the apple blossoms to a mid-summer hail that pulled the raspberry crop off of the bushes. One year we had such a severe drought that the crops just shriveled up. The next year, however, we had so much rain that every one of our crops became plagued with mold. To add insult to injury, the farm operating costs were rapidly running out of reach as oil prices were on the rise.
			</p>
			<p>
				By 2001, Greig Farm declared bankruptcy. I was ten years old and I had watched the rise and fall of a small empire that most of the world never even knew existed.
			</p>
			<p>
				We liquidated most of the assets, sold off some land, and recovered the bare essentials necessary to maintain a small operation. The farm lived on, but it was stripped of it’s character.
			</p>
			<p>
				My dad, who has run the farm since the 1970s, is now in his sixties. I’ve watched him spend the last decade rebuilding, but its clear that the ambition he once inspired a community with has now escaped him.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyone who has ever driven a tractor across a field for fourteen hours on end will tell you that it is humbling work. It’s simple work that in many ways is a form of meditation that shapes so many farmers into such down-to-earth people.
			</p>
			<p>
				After high school, I earned a degree in mechanical engineering, fell in love with Boston’s community of small tech companies, and found myself on track for a Harvard MBA. It’s a promising trajectory to be on, but its my professional trajectory that leaves me, as an only child, worried about the fate of Greig Farm’s future. I miss the simple complexities of farm work and I long to restore the farm to what it once was.
			</p>
			<p>
				So many of the people in the farm’s little community often asked me if I would take over the farm when I grew up. With Boston in my sights, I often joked by replying “I’ve been working on the farm since I was four — I’m just about ready to retire from this career.”
			</p>
			<p>
				The secret truth is that I would love to take over the farm, but I think I could only do so if I could afford to do it recreationally. Growing up, I watched financial decisions kill something wonderful. If I returned to run the farm, I would only want to make decisions that allowed me to rebuild what the community had lost.
