					How Engineering School is Killing Creativity

				When I went through the college application process, I struggled to choose between art school and engineering school. I was really into photography and graphic design, but was also filled with ideas. I wanted to design and build things; I wanted to make a difference. Art and engineering may seem to be on opposite ends of the spectrum, but I had this notion that engineering is actually a very creative field.
			</p>
			<p>
				My first semester at Northeastern University supported that idea, as the intro level mechanical engineering courses promoted the ideation and creation of solutions. As we were ushered forward through the curriculum, however, the creative door was shut behind us, and our heads were gradually filled with scientific limitations and constraints.
			</p>
			<p>
				Engineers are taught to think rationally, which is our biggest disadvantage. Our education is framed by laws. Newton, Hooke, Bernoulli. These concrete ideas build a maze of barriers that stifle creative thought. Of course, it’s important to be aware of these laws, but innovation requires the careful management of constraints. We need to allow ourselves to choose when to enter the maze.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why did I choose to pursue engineering school? Square and rectangle. Artists likely won’t make good engineers, but engineers can absolutely be artists. The scientific and mathematical framework we have built around ourselves can not be used as an excuse to forgo creativity. Design of beautiful products and systems does not compete with quality engineering practice. We’re problem solvers, and the design challenges we face are begging for a fresh approach.
			</p>
			<p>
				So how can you exit the maze? Believe that laws are meant to be broken — throw Newton and Bernoulli out the window. At least during your initial brainstorming work. Dream up the ideal situation. Look for inspiration in entirely different fields. Take up a creative hobby — sketching, painting, basket-weaving. Work on projects outside of your area of expertise, with people of different disciplines. Just have fun with it!
