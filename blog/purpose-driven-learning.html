			<p>
				The original American higher education institutions agreed on an approach that aimed to develop nothing more than mental grit in students through tedious tasks of translating ancient languages and completing sets of mathematical problems.  As the socioeconomic conditions changed, American higher education went through the first of many periods of reform and fragmentation that have reshaped the curriculum in many different ways.
			</p>
			<p>
				While the curriculum of the original approach was heavily scripted, the liberal approach that soon followed was an overcompensation that allowed students total freedom to define their own path.  
			</p>
			<p>
				The current state of education has landed somewhere in the middle of these two approaches.  Students have the freedom to select their course of study, but there is limited flexibility to explore within their selected major.
			</p>
			<p>
				Declaring a major in college is one of the most pivotal decisions that we face in our lives.  It is a four-year commitment to study a discipline that sets one’s professional trajectory. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe that much of what makes this decision so difficult is that a student's choice of major is an extrapolation from their passion.
			</p>
			<p>
				We never say “I am passionate about the human anatomy,” or “I want to spend my life designing mechanisms.”  We don’t define our passion by the daily tasks that might make up our profession; we define passion through a macro perspective of the impact we want to have in the world.  We want to help relieve poverty overseas or redefine the future of transportation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Selecting a major forces students to boil their vision down to developing a skill set that may later be applied to their passion.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to seek out employment that directly matches a student’s passion with the skill set they have developed.  Graduates often find themselves in a position that only allows them to pursue their passion through a heavily-diluted or tangentially-related opportunity.
			</p>
			<p>
				If higher education is to be viewed as an investment in one's professional future, then it is worth considering the period over which that investment pays out.  In my parent's generation, higher education was a gateway to a lifelong career; their education paid dividends throughout their entire professional life.  The current generation of college graduates are changing careers more frequently than any generation in the past, which yet again places higher education in position ready for reform.  
			</p>
			<p>
				The internet has brought about so many new tools and opportunities that are making it easier and easier to explore other interests, pick up a new skill, and make a career change.  As young professionals develop new skills and move on to new positions in other industries, their formal education becomes less and less relevant.
			</p>
			<p>
				Learning in the workplace is different.  Employees seek out knowledge that is directly relevant to the challenge they are tackling.  Workplace learning has purpose, rather than an abstract extrapolation of purpose.  It is a true form of experiential learning - one that allows students to research, apply, and create in rapid iteration.  
			</p>
			<h3>
				What if this purpose-driven learning were applied to education?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Students could express the purpose of their education in terms of the impact they want to make in the world.  They would attend university to explore solutions to water pollution, imagine the future of virtual reality, or develop more intelligent ways to use energy.  Instead of defining a major, students would investigate the current state of the world, driven by their own curiosity, and collaborate with other students under the mentorship of a diverse set of professors and industry leaders.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this model, students would have the freedom to dive deep in particular skill or develop a broad set of skills, based on the needs of the area they choose to explore.  They would take classes not to complete a pre-determined curriculum, but rather to fill gaps in their knowledge as they are uncovered.  Students would still develop skills that are relevant to their future employment, but they would be able to discuss their skills not in terms of accreditation, but instead in terms of the work they’ve done, the things they have created, and the impact they have had on the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Purpose-driven education would be flexible, but focused.  Students would only stay at their university for as long as they found it valuable.  Some may leave after a year to go explore a new opportunity elsewhere, while others may to stick around for years to pursue a research opportunity with a mentor on campus.  Each new semester would create a point for students to re-evaluate the value delivered by their education before deciding whether or not to continue.  If the duration of a student's education is determined by its ability to continue to deliver value to that student, then universities are framed as a resource, rather than a gateway.  Employers would no longer look for that resume line item that verifies a student has spent a set number of years at a university.  Instead, they would see how and when a student made use of a university to strategically advance their professional abilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the problems that I have with the concept of declaring a major is that it can go stale.  The world is a rapidly changing place, especially given the speed at which we are currently advancing technology.  The demand for various occupations is constantly rising and falling, so focusing one’s education on developing a skill set that in the future may no longer be needed brings about inherent risk.
			</p>
			<p>
				The beauty of purpose-driven learning is that it will always be relevant.  If universities were structured as a flexible bank of resources that included workshops, online classes, mentors, and more, they would always be able to provide meaningful value to students when they return to campus to prepare for their first or fifth career.
