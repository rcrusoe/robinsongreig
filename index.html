			<h2>
				Change is Hard
			</h2>
			<p>
				We all exhibit a deep desire to improve our lives. Perhaps this is part of what makes us uniquely human. Personal change enables us to lead happier and more fulfilled lives. It enriches the lives of those around us. It enables us to rise up and make a difference in this world.
			</p>
			<p>
				But change is hard.
			</p>
			<div class="multi-column">
				<p class="block6">
					So often, we set out to make a change only to find (a few months later) that we’re back where we started. For every person who has transformed their lives, there are another ninety-nine who have failed. And even for that one success story, there were likely scores of failed attempts before it finally worked.
				</p>
				<img src="http://i.giphy.com/dACqNmvAfY12M.gif" class="block4">
			</div>
			<p>
				It seems strange that our ability to change - something that holds the key to unlocking our best selves - is rife with so many missteps and so much self criticism.
			</p>
			<p>
				Perhaps we've been thinking about change wrong...
			</p>
			<h2>
				The Origins of <i>Humans</i>
			</h2>
			<p>
				When starting <a href="http://www.changecollective.com">Change Collective</a> (expert-led courses for behavior change with 1-on-1 coaching) we were initially reluctant to pull together our own comprehensive theory that described how change works.  In hacking our own lives and in coaching other people through change, we've seen enough to appreciate that behavior change is… well… nuanced.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are some really smart people - psychologists, behavioral economists, neuroscientists, and plenty more “ists” - who have been thinking about change for millennia, and their frameworks and theories are all compelling.  <strong><span class="tweet-this"> Still, there seems to be no one-size-fits-all theory to bring about change in your life.</span><a class="tweet-this-button" href="http://ctt.ec/J48UL" onclick="return popitup('http://ctt.ec/J48UL')">Tweet</a></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Through our experience, we realized that there are a few reason why there are many excellent, but conflicting, models for behavior change:
			</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>
					We each have a unique personality, which leads to models that work well for some people and not for others.
				</li>
				<li>
					Each change is different, so the same model may work well one day, and not the next.
				</li>
				<li>
					Despite decades of scientific research, clinical practice, and the great wisdom traditions of the ages, we still understand little about behavior change, and more generally about the human mind and brain.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<i>Humans</i> offers a comprehensive review of all of those models, a discussion of how you might apply them, and a new take on how to think about the entire process of making change happen in your life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let’s start by diving right into the latter...

				The feedback loop for behavior change is broken.
			</p>
			<p>
				Changing an ingrained behavior or creating a new one <span class="tweet-this">requires that you endure some level of discomfort before you advance your cause.</span><a class="tweet-this-button" href="http://ctt.ec/8PZ2L" onclick="return popitup('http://ctt.ec/8PZ2L')">Tweet</a> It gets harder before it gets easier. Persevering through this voluntarily - when our evolutionary wiring is screaming at us to "turn back!" - is not normal.
			</p>
			<p>
				This sets up a contentious relationship from the start. It makes us approach change as if it were a cold shower. We only jump in if we absolutely need to.
			</p>
			<p>
				But what if the water was actually warm from time to time, and you didn’t have to jump all the way in to find out? 
			</p>
			<h2>
				A New Lens: Change As An Experiment
			</h2>
			<p>
				We’d like to propose a new lens for how we approach change: that we think about each change as an experiment, not a giant undertaking.
			</p>
			<p>
				We’ll say that again because it’s so important. <strong><span class="tweet-this"> Instead of thinking about any new lifestyle change as a giant project, first approach it as an experiment to decide whether it works for you.</span><a class="tweet-this-button" href="http://ctt.ec/l5WnG" onclick="return popitup('http://ctt.ec/l5WnG')">Tweet</a></strong> Look at your situation. Figure out a good first step. Try it out. Then repeat.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every personal attempt to change is then a unique, "n of 1" scientific experiment into unknown territory. This makes curiosity, self-compassion, and the willingness to fail requisite skills. Sometimes you’ll succeed and other times you’ll fail, but either way you’ll win - by learning something new about yourself.
			</p>
			<p>
				In our own lives and in the lives of thousands of course-takers at Change, this approach has consistently delivered results. It has worked well in spite of, or perhaps due to, not being tied to a single behavior change model. It’s been so successful that we rethought our product, and indeed our entire approach to behavior change.

				We Need Your Help

				But we’re only just scratching the surface here. We’re excited to have you join us as we delve into the world of change. Through this email series, you’ll acquire knowledge and skills that aid you in your own experiments, and we’ll need your help in thinking through some of the tough questions. But be forewarned: you’ll leave with more questions than answers, an inevitable outcome in any truly human field of inquiry.

			<h2>
				A Little Background
			</h2>
			<p>
				Before we dive headlong into depths of change theory, it’s worth discussing one of the most widely accepted theories of behavior change.
			</p>
			<p>
				Back in the early 1980’s, James O. Prochaska and his colleagues at the University of Rhode Island developed a model to outline the process of behavior change.<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>  It’s called the "Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change" (or TTM) because it’s based on 300 different theories of psychotherapy and an analysis of the leading theories of behavior change.<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup> It details the six stages of change:

			<p>
				Where the TTM pushed the envelope was in thinking about change as a process that happens over time, rather than an "all or nothing" moment in people’s lives.<sup><a href="#references">2,3</a></sup> It also lines up well with our own common sense - we’ve all experienced the waxing and waning of our motivation and interest levels in taking on something new.
			</p>
			<p>
				But the TTM isn’t without its shortcomings.<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup> The very notion of "stages" give the impression that behavior change is a straightforward progression of discrete steps. The reality, of course, is much more complicated. Every change we take on can jump forward and backward through the process, sometimes skipping steps along the way. Behaviors that made it to maintenance can easily drop back to contemplation at the drop of a hat.
			</p>
			<h2>
				The 21 Day Fallacy
			</h2>
			<p>
				This idea - that change isn’t a straightforward process - is a little different from an idea that pervades our self help culture... If you asked the average person on the street, "How long does it take to build a new habit?,"" most would reply "21 days" without batting an eye.
			</p>
			<p>
				This '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLq27iOW0R0">set it and forget it</a>' idea essentially argues that you can move yourself all the way from contemplation to termination in three weeks, with the new behavior now a permanent fixture in your life.
			</p>
			<p>
				It appears that this myth actually originated from anecdotal evidence of patients who received plastic surgery and seemed to adapt to their new appearance in 21 days.<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup> The truth, of course, is much more nuanced.
			</p>
			<p>
				A study carried out at the University College London asked 96 participants to make a new eating, drinking, or exercise behavior part of their routine. The study was looking to see how long it took for these new behaviors to become automatic.<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				On average, it took 66 days until a habit became automatic, with plenty of variation (a range of 18 to 254 days) between the (relatively simple) eating, drinking, and exercise behaviors. Generally speaking, the more complex the behavior, the longer it took for it to become automatic.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Each change, it turns out, takes much longer than a magical 21 days of consistent effort to turn into a habit. Keep this in mind as you set out on the next one.
